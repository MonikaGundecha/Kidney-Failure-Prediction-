This Kidney Failure Risk Analysis project for health insurance leveraged NHANES data to predict kidney failure risk and optimize insurance offerings. This Kidney Failure Risk Analysis project for health insurance leveraged NHANES data to predict kidney failure risk and optimize insurance offerings. The project involved merging 6 NHANES datasets using user ID as the primary key, combining information related to demographics, medical history, lab tests, and diet of patients, with over 143 variables, using SQL to create comprehensive train and test datasets. Preprocessing involved tailored strategies for different variable types, including age group-specific imputations and median replacements. Exploratory analysis uncovered gender-specific trends in blood pressure and cholesterol levels across age groups. Kidney Failure Prediction models were developed using Logistic Regression with backward selection and Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), achieving over 96% accuracy in both models. Key findings identified critical predictors including age, gender, biomarkers, and blood pressure. The project's business impact includes recommendations for personalized insurance packages and risk assessment strategies, laying the groundwork for advancing kidney disease prevention and management in the health insurance sector.
